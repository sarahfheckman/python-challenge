# Financial and Voter Data
Python can be used to quickly measure data. In these two examples, Python was used to read in data from a CSV file and from there, was used to quickly calculate some valuable insights for both potential scenarios. 

## PyBank 
Creating an overview of the company PyBank's financial standings was made simple through the use of for loops. Quick statistics of the company included calculating the number of months in question, the highest/lowest performing months, total revenue, and the average monthly change in revenue.

## PyPoll
For a small town's election records, the winning candidate (as well as their win percentage) was quickly discovered. This method, rather than their old method of individually counting each vote, proved much more efficient.
